# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  

# About me
Currently a master student in CMU. Major in MSPPM. 

My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/huiyanxu04/

# What I hope to learn
1. Simple and effective visualization.
2. Better combination of data, graphs, and my story!
3. How we lead audience to believe our idea.

## Assignment 2: [Visualizing government Debt](visualizing-government-debt.md) 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a lot of interesting, easy to use and downloadable datasets, and also includes a tool that allows you a way to embed interactive visualizations directly from their website.  A number of web-based tools allow you to create data visualizations directly and then embed them somewhere else, so the first part of this assignment will involve taking the code for the generated visualization you've customized and placing it on your own portfolio page.  

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](cheapest protein homework.md) 
You recently read Design and Redesign in Data Visualization that talked about the critique by design method.  For this week you're going to be completing your own critique by design. In weeks one and two you completed a critique (week one) and a data visualization (week two) using information and data that was provided to you.  In week three it will be up to you to do the following: 
- Step one: select a visualization to redesign from MakeoverMonday (https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/Links to an external site.)
- Step two: critique the visualization
- Step three: wireframe a solution
- Step four: test the solution
- Step five: build your solution

This workflow is similar to what you'll be using to complete your final project, so if you can get comfortable with using each section to your full advantage, your final output will be more impactful.  Each step is outlined in detail below.  

## Final project: [webiste](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/stop-ivory-trade/index.html)
